# AutoPhotoUploader

# This is a work in progress

A succinct and easy to use C# library for the Flickr API does not exist, so I'm making one.


# Checkpoints:

1. Implement OAuth 1.0 routine to authenticate users - DONE

2. Finish creating Flickr User object and create common methods to do actions such as upload and manage photos - In Progress
